Front Door: Front Door routes incoming requests to the primary region. If the application running in that region becomes unavailable, Front Door fails over to the secondary region.

A multi-region deployment can use an active-active or active-passive configuration. An active-active configuration distributes requests across multiple active regions. An active-passive configuration keeps warm instances in the secondary region, but doesnâ€™t send traffic there unless the primary region fails.
